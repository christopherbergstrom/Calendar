How to use: Search for any month by its name or number (so far the days are only right with January) to see itâ€™s days like a normal calendar. You are then able to click on any day and add an event to it. You can also delete events. Eventually events with be specific to each day and not carry over to every day you select, the months and days will be fixed, and you will be able to update events.<br>
